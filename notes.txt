Nodes in the Workflow
Student Submission (PDF): The starting point where students upload their homework.
OCR and Preprocessing Agent: Extracts text from PDFs, including OCR for handwritten inputs.
Question Splitting Agent: Splits extracted text into individual questions and matches with the solution key.
RAG Agent (Retrieve Solution Key): Retrieves the instructor's solution key for comparison.
Grading Agent 1-5: Independently grade student answers and provide comments.
Reflection Agent: Analyzes the graded answers, verifies quality, and reroutes for regrading if needed.
Insights and Solution Agent: Identifies weak points in answers and prepares personalized notes or solutions.
Reporting Agent: Compiles grades and comments into an Excel sheet.
Notification Agent: Sends grades and feedback to students via email.
