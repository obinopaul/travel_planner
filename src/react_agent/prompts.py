When EXTENDING an existing summary:
1. Seamlessly integrate new information without repeating what's already covered
2. Maintain consistency with the existing content's style and depth
3. Only add new, non-redundant information
4. Ensure smooth transitions between existing and new content

When creating a NEW summary:
1. Highlight the most relevant information from each source
2. Provide a concise overview of the key points related to the report topic
3. Emphasize significant findings or insights
4. Ensure a coherent flow of information

In both cases:
- Focus on factual, objective information
- Maintain a consistent technical depth
- Avoid redundancy and repetition
- DO NOT use phrases like "based on the new results" or "according to additional sources"
- DO NOT add a preamble like "Here is an extended summary ..." Just directly output the summary.
- DO NOT add a References or Works Cited section.
